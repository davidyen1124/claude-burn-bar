### 🧵 A THREAD on why I built Claude Burn Bar (1/420)

So there I was, asking Claude to write my grocery list for the 47th time today when my bank called. Apparently "AI-assisted breathing instructions" isn't a valid business expense. Who knew? 🤷‍♂️

That's when I realized: **I needed to track exactly how much money I was setting on fire.**

## 💸 What Nobody Tells You About Claude Addiction

Did you know:
- 🔥 One Claude query = 0.0003 trees murdered
- 💧 Every token you generate evaporates someone's drinking water
- 📱 Your daily Claude usage could charge 13,000 iPhones (or 1 iPhone 13,000 times)
- 🍕 That $200 subscription could buy 57 large pizzas

**This app shows you EXACTLY how much environmental damage you're causing while asking Claude to explain why your code doesn't work (spoiler: it's the semicolon).**

## 🎯 10 SHOCKING Features That Will Make You Question Your Life Choices

### 1. THE MONEY COUNTER OF DOOM 💀
Watch your net worth decrease IN REAL TIME! Nothing says "productivity" like seeing "$247.83" in your menubar and knowing that's just TODAY.

### 2. THE GUILT CONVERTER 3000™️
Instantly converts your API usage into:
- 🌳 Dead trees (RIP)
- 💧 Evaporated water (someone's thirsty)
- 🔋 iPhone charges (could've been mining crypto instead)
- 💡 60W lightbulb hours (retro!)

### 3. THE 5% CLUB TRACKER 🏆
Shows if you've reached the elite "5% Club" of top spenders, or how painfully close you are to joining.

### 4. ASCII ART THAT SLAPS
```
★★★☆ = You're almost at "sell a kidney" level!
```

### 5. SARCASTIC STATUS MESSAGES
A random passive-aggressive message appears in every menu refresh:
- "wallet-melting..."
- "tree-murdering..."
- "gpu-liquefying..."
- "inheritance-draining..."
- "bank-calling..."
- "savings-evaporating..."

Because even your menubar should judge you.

## 🧪 The "Science" Behind The Magic

We use GRADIENT DESCENT™️ to calculate your ecological footprint:
- **1 token = 0.0000006 kWh** (source: my cousin who works at a data center)
- **1 kWh = 1.8L of water** (it's for cooling the GPUs you're melting)
- **1 tree absorbs 10kg CO₂/year** (they're trying their best ok?)
- **1 pizza = $3.50** (NYC prices because we're fancy)

### 💭 Final Thoughts From The Creator

*"I started this project to track my Claude usage. I ended up questioning the meaning of existence and whether CSS is worth destroying the planet for. Anyway, here's a menubar app."*

**⭐ STAR THIS REPO = 1 TREE PLANTED***
