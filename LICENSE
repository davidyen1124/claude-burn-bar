Copyright (c) 2025 The Guy Who Can't Stop Asking Claude To Write Email Signatures

## 🚨 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND MAKING POOR FINANCIAL DECISIONS

### 1. DEFINITIONS

- **"The Software"**: This guilt-inducing menubar app that reminds you of your financial irresponsibility
- **"You"**: The person who definitely has a Claude problem  
- **"Trees"**: The innocent victims of your code debugging sessions
- **"Bankruptcy"**: Your inevitable future

### 2. GRANT OF LICENSE

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge (unlike Claude), to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Wallet Destroyer"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to:

- ✅ **USE** it to track your descent into financial ruin
- ✅ **COPY** it to all your devices so you can feel bad everywhere
- ✅ **MODIFY** it to add even more guilt-inducing metrics  
- ✅ **MERGE** it with your tears
- ✅ **PUBLISH** screenshots to Twitter for internet points
- ✅ **DISTRIBUTE** to other Claude addicts (misery loves company)
- ✅ **SUBLICENSE** to your therapist
- ✅ **SELL** copies (gotta recoup those Claude costs somehow)

Subject to the following conditions:

### 3. THE ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software, along with:

- A confession of how much you've spent on Claude this month
- Your most embarrassing Claude query (we all have one)
- A formal apology to at least three (3) trees

### 4. THE GUILT CLAUSE

By using this software, you acknowledge that:

1. You have a problem
2. The first step is admitting it
3. The second step is probably asking Claude how to fix it
4. You're part of the problem
5. Those GPUs aren't going to melt themselves

### 5. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

- WARRANTIES THAT YOU'LL STOP USING CLAUDE
- WARRANTIES THAT YOUR BANK ACCOUNT WILL RECOVER  
- WARRANTIES THAT THE TREES WILL FORGIVE YOU
- WARRANTIES THAT THE ECO CALCULATIONS ARE EVEN REMOTELY ACCURATE
- WARRANTIES THAT THIS WILL HELP YOUR PRODUCTIVITY (IT WON'T)

### 6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR:

- Your Claude bills
- Relationship damage from spending more on AI than dates
- Career damage from asking Claude to do your job
- Environmental damage (that's on you, buddy)
- Existential crises triggered by the app
- Sudden urges to become a Luddite

### 7. SPECIAL PROVISIONS

#### 7.1 The "5% Club" Clause
If your daily spend puts you in the top 5% of Claude users, you must:
- Seek immediate financial counseling
- Consider a digital detox
- Maybe learn to code without AI (revolutionary concept)

#### 7.2 The Tree Redemption Program
For every 100 trees worth of damage shown by the app, you should:
- Go outside (remember that place?)
- Touch grass (it's the green stuff)
- Contemplate your choices

#### 7.3 The Anthropic Clause
This license in no way endorses spending your life savings on Claude. Anthropic's lawyers made us say that.

### 8. TERMINATION

This license automatically terminates if:
- You hit Anthropic's rate limits
- Your credit card gets declined
- You achieve enlightenment and realize you can Google things

### 9. GOVERNING LAW

This License shall be governed by the laws of:
- The State of Denial
- The Republic of Poor Financial Decisions  
- The Commonwealth of "It's Just One More API Call"

### 10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior agreements, including that promise you made to yourself about "cutting back on AI usage."

---

## 🤝 IN WITNESS WHEREOF

By using this software, you digitally sign this agreement with the tears of your wallet.
